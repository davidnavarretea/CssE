# `05` Specificity

When creating a CSS document, you need to start from the most generic selectors and end with the most specific ones, that is the way CSS works.


It's all about the level of Specificity. If you specify that your `div` with `id="thirditem` has a yellow background, and later in the document you specify that all `divs` will have blue background, `#thirditem` will keep his yellow background. punto!

*Because the more specific, the more priority it has.* 

## üìù Instrucciones:

1. Override the background-color of #thirditem without deleting any css code, simply append to the css a more specific rule at the end of the document to override the background-color to green.


### üí° Hint:

You can use the **important!** annotation:
