# `01.1` The Style Tag

If you want to add styles into a website by writing CSS you have to always add it within a `<style>` tag.
You can have as many style tags as you want but it is recomended to have only one at the beginning of your website code.

```HTML
<style>
    /* the website CSS Styles go here */
</style>
```
